# JkGRFxMod

A modification of JkGfxMod specifically built for JkGR

## Features

- Cog controllable distance fog, includes new Cog verbs
- SSAO fades with distance so it no longer affects skyboxes
- Other Cog controllable VFX such as film grain, vignette and color filters


## VFX configuration (`jkgm.json`)

Optional boolean master switches, all `true` by default:

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `enable_fog` | Renders COG-controlled distance fog; COG parameters are still stored if disabled |
| `enable_reflections` | Enables material environment reflections (including fixed/MatCap and the planned SSR); disabling restores the unreflected diffuse appearance |
| `enable_post` | Enables optional presentation effects (bloom, film grain, vignette, brightness/contrast/saturation); sRGB output remains active when disabled |
| `enable_blur` | Legacy master switch for all three blur effects |
| `enable_frame_blend` | Enable/disable lightweight temporal feedback independently |
| `enable_distance_blur` | Enable/disable distance-based spatial blur independently |
| `enable_peripheral_blur` | Enable/disable peripheral spatial blur independently |

The existing `enable_ssao` switch remains independent of `enable_post`, making it useful for testing SSAO artifacts. `enable_bloom` independently disables bloom even when `enable_post` is true.

### Fog COG changes

Fog no longer has separate enabled state. `SetFogInfo(vector(start, end, opacity), fadeTime)` uses opacity alone, where `0` disables fog. `GetFogInfo()`, `SetFogColor()`, `GetFogColor()`, and `ResetFog()` remain. The old `SetFogEnabled` and `GetFogEnabled` verbs have been removed; existing COGs using those verbs must be updated.

The default fog parameters are `40 1000 0` (off). Setting opacity nonzero fades fog in according to `fadeTime`.


## COG-controlled frame blending

Temporal accumulation is applied to the **finished composited frame** (including
gameplay, HUD, bloom, film grain and color adjustments) in linear color space,
with hardware sRGB output conversion preserved. It needs no changes to
`jk.exe`; the verbs are registered through the existing community patch `JK.dll`
hook.

```c
SetFrameBlend(0.75, 0.5); // Fade to 75% previous accumulated output over 0.5 seconds.
flex amount = GetFrameBlend(); // Current interpolated strength, 0.0..1.0.
SetFrameBlend(1.0, 0.0); // Freeze the last completed frame.
SetFrameBlend(0.0, 0.5); // Fade back to live gameplay.
ResetFrameBlend();       // Disable blending AND discard history immediately.
```

The accumulation formula is `output = current * (1 - strength) + previous * strength`,
where `previous` is the last **blended output**, not the last raw frame.
Strength `0` means no trails; values close to `1` yield a long afterimage;
`1` holds the last displayed frame. Defaults to `0`. A fade always begins
at the presently interpolated value; `fadeTime <= 0` updates immediately.

History is continuously refreshed even at strength 0, so turning on blending
does not show a stale old frame. It is invalidated on menu/game rendering-mode
transitions and when `ResetFrameBlend()` is called. These transitions also reset
the effect's strength to zero to avoid carrying a level effect into the menus.
The engine's per-frame `BeginScene`/`EndScene` hooks do not reset it.

`"enable_blur":false` prevents the history contribution while keeping the
COG-controlled parameters intact; use this for debugging. It does not turn
off bloom or SSAO. Frame blending is also independent of `enable_post`, which
only gates bloom, grain, vignette and color filtering.

**Known limitation:** A direct in-game level-to-level transition that never
enters menu rendering does not currently trigger an automatic reset. Such
transitions should call `ResetFrameBlend()` from a shutdown/startup COG.
The explicit history reset is also useful before cutscene camera teleports.


## COG-controlled distance and peripheral blur

These spatial effects are **disabled by default**. They are evaluated on
the full-resolution game scene in linear HDR before bloom, presentation
color processing, and recursive frame blending. Both are independently
fadeable and can be combined; `enable_blur:false` bypasses both, as
well as frame blending, without changing their stored COG parameters.

```c
// Vector = startDistance endDistance strength, fadeTime in seconds.
SetDistanceBlur(VectorSet(40, 100, 0.8), 1.0);
vector currentDistance = GetDistanceBlur();
ResetDistanceBlur();

// Vector = innerRadius outerRadius strength, fadeTime in seconds.
// Radii 0..1 are measured from screen center to the corners.
SetPeripheralBlur(VectorSet(0.45, 0.9, 0.7), 0.5);
vector currentPeripheral = GetPeripheralBlur();
ResetPeripheralBlur();
```

Both strengths are clamped to `[0,1]`. Zero disables that effect.
Distance thresholds are JK engine units (not pixels). The distance
intensity ramps from 0 at the start to full strength at the end;
pixels without valid depth do not receive *distance* blur. Peripheral
blur is radial, with 0 at the center and 1 at the far corners.
All values animate over the requested `fadeTime`, using the same
wall-clock mechanism as the other COG effects.

The implementation uses horizontal and vertical 9-tap Gaussian passes.
Maximum blur extends about 12 screen pixels per axis at strength 1;
the radius grows smoothly as the amount grows. Distance blur prefers
samples of similar depth to reduce foreground/background bleed.
Peripheral blur deliberately can cross depth boundaries.

These effects use the existing opaque G-buffer depth. Consequently,
they operate on the finished scene image and can also blur HUD and
transparent objects lying over distant geometry; blur deliberately
remains in screen space. They do not alter the source 3DOs, skybox
geometry, or SSAO. The currently displayed parameters reset to off
when switching between menu and gameplay. For a direct game-to-game
level change without a menu transition, call both Reset* verbs from a COG
if level-specific effects must not persist.


### Blur performance switches

The three blur effects can now be independently disabled in `jkgm.json`:

```json
"enable_blur": true,
"enable_frame_blend": true,
"enable_distance_blur": false,
"enable_peripheral_blur": true
```

All switches default to `true` for compatibility. `enable_blur:false`
still overrides all three. Disabled distance/peripheral effects are ignored
when computing the spatial kernel; **when both are disabled, the entire pair
of expensive full-screen spatial passes is skipped**. Disabling frame blending
removes its history contribution without clearing the COG parameters, so
turning it on again resumes from fresh frame history. You can continue
using the matching `Set*()` verbs regardless of the switches.
